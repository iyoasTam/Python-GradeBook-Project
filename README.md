# Python-GradeBook-Project
In this pandas project, I created a Python script that loads your grade data and calculates letter grades for your students.

This pandas project involves four main steps:

Explore the data I used in the project to determine which format and data I needed to calculate the final grades.
Load the data into pandas DataFrames, making sure to connect the grades for the same student across all the data sources.
Calculate the final grades and save them as CSV files.
Plot the grade distribution and explore how the grades vary among students.
